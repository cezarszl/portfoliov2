            Born and raised in CzÄ™stochowa, Poland. I fell in love with
            computers and technology from the first Commodore 64. For this
            reason, I educated myself at the local university in the department
            of computer science. After a long 10-year stay in Great Britain and
            gaining experience in other industries, I joined the rest of my
            family and moved to Hanover, Germany. With major changes, I decided
            to take part in CareersFoundry&apos;s bootcamp and return to what I
            love, which is programming.

          Besides new technologies, I am a big fan of football, tennis, and
          esports. Moreover, I try to spend every vacation traveling. In 2023, I
          completed the Caminho de Portugal, which is over 300 km of hiking
          through Portugal to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

          I enjoy the full spectrum of web development, but I&apos;m
          particularly passionate about integrating front-end and back-end
          technologies to create seamless user experiences. On the front-end, I
          love crafting interactive and visually appealing interfaces using
          modern frameworks like React or Angular. This involves a lot of
          creative problem-solving and design thinking, which are aspects I find
          deeply rewarding. On the back-end, I&apos;m intrigued by the challenge
          of designing robust APIs and optimizing database interactions to
          ensure performance and scalability. Working with databases, whether
          SQL or NoSQL, allows me to structure data effectively and leverage it
          to drive the application&apos;s functionality. What excites me the
          most is seeing all these components come together into a cohesive and
          functional application that provides real value to users.
